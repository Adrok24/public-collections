Name: ESA WorldCover
Description: |
  The European Space Agency (ESA) WorldCover is a global land cover map with 11 different land cover classes produced at 10m resolution based on combination of both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. 
  In areas where Sentinel-2 images are covered by clouds for an extended period of time, Sentinel-1 data then provides complimentary information on the structural 
  characteristics of the observed land cover. Therefore, the combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data makes it possible to update the land cover map almost in real time. 
  WorldCover Map has been produced for 2020 and 2021 with a global coverage as part of the 5th Earth Observation Envelope Programme (EOEP-5). It provides valuable information for applications such as biodiversity, food security, carbon assessment and climate modelling.
