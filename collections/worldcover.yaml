Name: WorldCover
Description: |
  [WorldCover](https://esa-worldcover.org/en) is a global land cover map produced at 10m resolution based on combination of both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. 
  In areas where Sentinel-2 images are covered by clouds for an extended period of time, Sentinel-1 data then provides complimentary information on the structural 
  characteristics of the observed land cover. Therefore, the combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data makes it possible to update the land cover map almost in real time. 
  WorldCover has been produced for 2020 with a global coverage. It provides valuable information for applications such as biodiversity, food security, carbon assessment and climate modelling.
